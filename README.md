# ds_with_python

This is a repository where I upload jupyter notebooks, practicing with famous data science python libraries, like matplotlib, pandas, numpy or seaborn. 

The goals of this project are

- to strengthen my abilities with these libraries and to gain valuable insights
- to provide templates, in case I need to look up sth
- eventually an inspiration to others or as some sort of guidance, in case you happen to stumble across this
